Displaying Player Cards from Skybox assignment 

Hej Skybox,

Det her er min submission til at lave en webside med player cards af professionelle CSGO spillere.

I spent around 6 hours on the task, but it was spread out over short sessions over many days.

- I am not too happy about the way I structured the player cards, I underestimated the amount of code that 
  the PlayerCard component would need and it would have been better seperating the top, overall score and bottom compartments into seperate react components. 
  
- Due to the time constraint I wasnt able to implement the flares, lights and lines on the card. I couldnt apply a mask using overflow to the svg images
  so I decided to just exclude them from the final submission
  
- My plan was to implement a proper pending and error catching for the Rest apis and the GraphQl, but with the time frame these parts were not completed.
  so instead they produce a normal unspecific error in the console
  
As for feedback for the assignment, I thought it was quite fun, and I dont really have any complaints.
  
Thanks!
